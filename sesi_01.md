# Session 1

## What is Programming?

- In a data science context, programming can be seen as manipulation of data
- We program or give instructions to the computer so that it obtains, processes, and presents data

## Why Program?

- What is it to you? Whatâ€™s in it for you?
- Why is the data important to you?
- What will you do to the data to get what you want from it?

## Programming Languages

- Programming languages are usually different because they were made with certain tasks in mind
- Processing numbers is not the same as processing text

## R

- R is considered one of the leading programming languages for statistical analysis in many fields, from psychology to finance
- Many people just use it as a statistical calculator, depending on functions that other people have written
- R is actually a programming language but one that uses many advanced concepts
- R usually feels weird unless people understand these concepts (sometimes it still feels weird anyway)

## Python

- Python was designed to make programming "fun again"
- Its programs can usually be easily read, allowing users to focus more on workflow instead of ~~fighting~~ communicating with the computer
- While it lags behind R for general statistics, it has become very attractive for big data and machine learning
- Python needs add-ons called 'modules' to get many features that R already has
- Many hard-working contributors have created modules so that Python can catch up to R, including one that allows for the use of R code in Python

## This Workshop

- We will learn Python and R focusing on the programming principles behind them and how best to use them for basic data processing and presentation
- More specifically, we will learn enough Python to use it "like R" then focus on using either language for processing and presenting data
- We will mainly use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb)
- The workshop material was designed to be as broad as possible so feel free focus on the parts most relevant to you
- I encourage you to plan your study around the assignments, which will be the main form of assessment

## Assessments

- We will have three assessments which may be done individually or as a group
- The first two can just be sent to me as electronic documents via WhatsApp or published publically on your group's GitHub page (subject to change)
- The final assignment will be a live (offline) presentation
